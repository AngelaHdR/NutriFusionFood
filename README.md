# NUTRIFUSION FOOD

Hi, we are the creators of Nutrifusion Food, and today you are going to read what this 
project is about and how we made it.

Firstly, what is Nutrifusion Food, well, glad you asked. Nutrifusion Food is a web 
designed for foodies and people who love to eat and cook. Our goal is to make home made 
food more achievable for everyone, we plan to do this by making an online platform where 
people can look up recipes uploaded by certified nutritionists.

If you visit our page you will be able to see an extensive list of recipes. In each 
recipe you can see who uploaded it, the time it would take you and a small description. 
If you happen to like it, you can sign up to access the rest of the details, by clicking 
on the title you can see what ingredients and tools you will need as well as the steps to
complete it.

Also you can use it as other social media, if you like the recipes that a particular 
nutritionist posts you can directly look at their profile to see all the recipes that 
they have created. Each recipe has also a button to save it in your own profile as your 
favorite recipes.

If you sign up as a nutritionist you will have the same features as the other users 
and more. In your profile page you will have options to create new recipes and modify 
and delete the ones you have already created.

## 2. DESIGN
So now, let’s talk about the creative process behind the web. Here you can find the 
technologies that we used to decide the design of the web and the logo, the decisions 
that we made to choose the colors and typographies and the main page structures from our web.
### Technologies used
We did a Mockup of the page to help us with the design and organization of the different pages. 
We used two different tools for this task, the first one was *Mock Flow* with this tool we were 
able to create the main structure and display of the web. Once the structure was clear we took our 
design to Wix, here we defined the colors, size and styles of all the main pages in our website.

For the logo, we use *Smashing Logo* to find the basic idea and *Gimp* to modify the logo proposed, 
add our personal touches and adapt it to our design. We ended up with the logo that you can see here:

### Color palette
We wanted a style that was clean, attractive and sophisticated and we wanted to avoid the typical 
recipe blog that is overloaded with information, photos and random colors. We started with the idea of 
using three colors as a base for the design, one light color for the background, another more bright for 
the things that we want to stand out and the last one darker for the titles. We ended up with the combination 
that you can see down here:

### Mockup
The web is made up of 5 pages that you are allowed to access or not depending on your user status.

If you are not logged in you can only access the following pages:
- A landing page where users can log in, access to the categories of the recipes and get 
information with an About us section.
- A page full of recipes, it can be with all the recipes mixed or filtered by category. 
Each recipe has a photo, the name of the creator and a small description.

If you are logged in you can also access the following pages:
- A page with the details of the recipe. Which include the ingredients and tools required and the steps 
of the recipe.
- Your profile page, where you will have general information about you and your favorite recipes. If you 
are a nutritionist you have a section with your own recipes, that you can modify and delete.

If you are a nutritionist you have also access to one last page:
- A form to add new recipes to your profile.

We wanted our project to be as simple as possible, to make it accessible to all types of users, so the 
web is divided in a way that each page has not many uses and doesn’t overwhelm the users.

### Typography
We selected the following typographies because we wanted to reflect simplicity, elegancy and familiarity 
with our designs, also we wanted to stand out some parts thanks to the contrast of colors and styles on 
the titles.

We decided to go with Playfair Display for the main text:

And Forum for the titles, menu and other elements:
