# NUTRIFUSION FOOD

Hi, we are the creators of Nutrifusion Food, and today you are going to 
read what is this project about and how we made it.

Firstly, what is Nutrifusion Food, well, glad you asked. Nutrifusion is 
web designed for foodies and people who love to eat and cook. Our goal is 
to make home made food more achievable for everyone, we plan to do this by 
making an online platform where people can look up recipes uploaded by 
certified nutritionist, you are able to see who uploaded, the time and the 
steps it would take you and a small description, and as it happens to like it, 
you can click on it and see what ingredients and tools you will need.

## 2. DESIGN
So now, let’s talk about the creative process behind the web, and let’s start by 
what we used
### Technologies used
We did a Mockup of the page to help us with the design and organisation of the different pages. 
We used two different tools for this task, the first one was *x* with these tool we were able to
create the main structure and display of the web. Once the structure was clear we took our design to
Wix, here we defined the colors, size and styles of all the main pages in our website.
For the logo, we use *Exaclidraw* to find the basic idea and *Gimp* to modify the logo proposed and add 
our personal touches and adapt it to our design.
### Color palette
We started with the idea of using three colors as a base for the design, some kind of light blue for the 
background and some kind of salmon for the things that we want to stand out and a kind of dark blue for the 
title, something like what you can see down here.
### Typography
### Mockup
The web is made up of 4 pages:

A landing pages where user can log in, get information with an About Us, contact us and look what kind of food 
there is. Once you log in, you got a page where you can take a look at differents categories, each one with a 
photo and the name of that category. Inside each category you got many recipes, with a photo and a small description 
to know what you are going to make. Also, you can take a look to your profile in a different page, where you will 
your name, general information about you, your favorites dishes and if you are a nutritionist your own recipes. And also, 
for the nutritionists, you have a form for add new dishes.

We wanted our project to be as simple as possible, to make it accessible to all, so the web is divided in a way that each page has its use and doesn’t overwhelm the users.
